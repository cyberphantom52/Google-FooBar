# What is Foobar?
Foobar is a semi-secret hiring challenge Google put out there to find talented developers via somewhat unconventional yet fitting means. Foobar is a series of five levels of algorithmic questions of ever-increasing difficulty and allotted time to solve these questions. Once the developer requests a question, the clock starts ticking.

* Level 1: One Question — 48 hours
* Level 2: Two Questions — 72 hours for each question
* Level 3: Three Questions — 7 days for each question
* Level 4: Two Questions — 2 weeks for each question
* Level 5: One Question — 22 days
